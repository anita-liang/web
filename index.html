	<h3>Origins</h3>
	<p>Lana Del Rey was born Elizabeth Wooldridge Grant in Lake Placid, New York. She moved to New York City and attended Fordham University
		for a degree in metaphysics and philosophy. During her time in New York, she became acquantined with Stefani Germaotta or "Lady Gaga." They ended up having a 
		falling out but made up since then. While she had multiple psudenyoms throughout her career in which she released music under, such as "May Jailer" and 
		"Lizzy Grant", she received the most success under "Lana Del Rey" with five albums at the moment.

	<h4>Music</h4>
	<p>Her albums have incredible range. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4X8hAqIWpQyQks2yRhyqs4?si=1oqDiYRiS2-nJtDL7uxFAQ">Born To Die</a> has reached
		great success, being able to stay on the Billboard Top 200 for 300+ weeks. However, it wasn't as well received by critics, netting a 5.5 on pitchfork and 
		62 on metacritic. In comparison, Norman F*cking Rockwell is her newest album and is the most mature out of the five. It was extremely well received, with a 9.4 
		on pitchfork and 87 on metacritic, a testament to her growth as an artist. She has a large backlog of unreleased songs that were leaked. These are available on 
		Youtube or Soundcloud. 
	<h4>New Album</h4>
	<p>Lana's new album, "Chemtrails Over The Country Club" is coming out sometime in March. Already by the cover it's vastly different from her previous one's, featuring 
		her with her friends and family as opposed to her previous covers which only featured her. The singles "Chemtrails over the Country Club" and "Love Me Like A Woman" 
		are most similar to Norman F*cking Rockwell. But even then it's still different from what she's done before. Her sister's recent instagram post seems to imply that
		another song "White Dress" will be releasing soon.
